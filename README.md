# Mustangs for Housing Equity
Mustangs for Housing Equity created an app in which users are able to discover the rental housing market in the Metro Vancouver Regional District. 

# Team Mission Statement

Our team aims to create accessible and digestible content for the general public in order to be able to understand and even reproduce GIS products. We therefore exclusively used open-source data so that all of our sources could be verified or applied by viewers without requesting permission from data owners. Despite the complexity of the analysis techniques that we used, we ensured that the completed product was available as a dashboard with toggles and explanations for each layer and function of the map. 

The general public can become informed of issues on housing affordability. By using our app, they are able to navigate which neighborhoods may be sustainably affordable based on their income. Governments and NGOs may also navigate through the vacancy rates in the Metro Vancouver Regional District area to identify where housing development may be required. Ultimately, by having open-source data and making an accessible final app, our team will be actively supporting awareness and understanding of the Vancouver housing market, and broadly GIS products.
