## Team Mission Statement

Our team aims to create accessible and digestible content for the general public to better understand and reproduce GIS products. We exclusively use open-source data to ensure transparency, verifiability, and applicability without restrictions from data owners. Despite the complexity of the analysis techniques used, our final product is an interactive dashboard with toggles and explanations for each map layer and function. 

Through our app, users can:
- Explore **housing affordability** across Metro Vancouver based on income levels.
- Identify **vacancy rates** to understand housing availability.
- Assist **governments and NGOs** in pinpointing areas that may require housing development.

By leveraging open-source data and ensuring accessibility, we actively support public awareness and understanding of the Vancouver housing market and GIS applications in general.
